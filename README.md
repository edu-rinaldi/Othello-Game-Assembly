# Othello - MIPS

Game implemented in assembly (MIPS). 

**Note**: since the objective was to minimize the number of instructions, the code makes heavy use of macros so to remove any additional instruction (given for instance by a loop).

For testing the code I suggest to use [Mars simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).

## What are `".in"` and `".out"` files in the repository?
They are test files containing inputs and expected outputs respectively. You can ignore them or use them as a test base.
